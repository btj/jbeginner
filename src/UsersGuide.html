<h1>JBeginner User's Guide</h1>
<p>JBeginner is a tool for teaching and learning the Java programming language
at the introductory level. It enables the user to construct simple programs by selecting
program elements from menus, and to step through them.
All constructed programs are well-typed and there are no compiler errors;
in fact, there is no compilation.
While a user is stepping through the program,
the tool displays
the objects on the heap,
the frames on the stack,
and the variables they contain.
The tool is itself written in the Java programming language.</p>
